            <h1>About me!</h1>
            <p>My name is Anna Ringel, and I am 21 years old. I am a senior at Northwest Missouri State, and I will obtain a Bachelors of Fine Arts degree in the fall of 2025. I am also minoring in digital media.</p>
            <h3>Graphic Design</h3>
            <p>I love getting to design different elements for clients, friends, and family. Within graphic designing, I do a little bit of wedding graphic design. I also do requests for posters, logos, brochures, buisness cards, t-shirts, and really anything else you can think of.</p> 
            <h3>Photography</h3>
            <p>I also love to take pictures for clients, friends, and family. I do anything from senior pictures, to family pictures and wedding pictures, to nature and scenery shoots.</p>
